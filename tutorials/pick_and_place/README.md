# Pick-and-Place Tutorial

![](img/0_pick_place.gif)

This tutorial will go through the steps necessary to integrate ROS with Unity, from installing the Unity Editor to creating a scene with an imported URDF to completing a pick-and-place task with known poses using MoveIt trajectory planning. 

> Note: This project was built using the ROS Melodic distro and Python 2.

This part includes the preparation and setup necessary to run a pick-and-place task with known poses using MoveIt. Steps covered include creating and invoking a motion planning service in ROS, moving a Unity Articulation Body based on a calculated trajectory, and controlling a gripping tool to successfully grasp and drop an object.
